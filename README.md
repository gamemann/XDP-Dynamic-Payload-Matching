# XDP Dynamic Payload Matching Findings
This repository is used to store my findings on matching dynamic payloads in XDP. In my opinion, being able to match payload data from a BPF map is important for the future of XDP.

I made a thread on the XDP Newbies mailing list [here](https://marc.info/?l=xdp-newbies&m=158894658804356&w=2) addressing this. Unfortunately, it appears nobody has found a way to match XDP payload data dynamically yet.
